## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
- `services/otpService.js` - OTP generation, sending, and verification service
- `routes/otp.js` - API endpoints for OTP operations
- `public/views/forgot.html` - Forgot password page
- `public/css/forgot.css` - Styling for forgot password page
- `public/js/forgot.js` - JavaScript for forgot password functionality

### Files Modified:
- `server.js` - Added OTP routes
- `public/views/registration.html` - Added OTP verification section
- `public/views/loginpage.html` - Added forgot password link
- `public/js/registration.js` - Added OTP functionality

- `package.json` - Added nodemailer dependency

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
The required dependencies have been installed:
```bash
npm install nodemailer crypto
```

### 2. Configure Email Service
**Important**: You need to configure the email service in `services/otpService.js`:

```javascript
// Replace these with your actual email credentials
this.transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
    service: 'gmail', // or your email service
    auth: {
        user: 'your-actual-email@gmail.com', // Your email
        pass: 'your-app-password' // Your app password (not regular password)
    }
});
```

**For Gmail:**
1. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
2. Generate an App Password (not your regular password)
3. Use the app password in the configuration

### 3. Update Email Templates
In `services/otpService.js`, update the sender email in:
- Line 52: `from: 'your-actual-email@gmail.com'`

### 4. Test the System
1. Start your server: `npm start`
2. Navigate to registration page
3. Fill in the form and submit
4. Check the OTP section appears
5. Check your email for the OTP
6. Test the forgot password flow from login page

## üîê Security Features

- **OTP Expiry**: OTPs expire after 5 minutes
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam by clearing old OTPs before sending new ones
- **Email Validation**: Server-side email format validation
- **Account Verification**: Forgot password requires username, email, and mobile match
- **Password Requirements**: Strong password validation with real-time feedback

## üéØ User Flow

### Registration Flow:
1. User fills registration form
2. System validates all fields
3. System sends OTP to user's email
4. User enters OTP within 5 minutes
5. System verifies OTP
6. Registration completes, user redirects to login

### Forgot Password Flow:
1. User clicks "Forgot Password" on login page
2. User enters username, email, and mobile number
3. System verifies account details match
4. System sends OTP to user's email
5. User enters OTP within 5 minutes
6. User sets new password with validation
7. Password is updated, user redirects to login

## üì± Responsive Design

- Both registration OTP section and forgot password page are fully responsive
- Mobile-friendly layouts with proper touch interactions
- Modern CSS with gradients and animations
- Accessible form validation with visual feedback

## ‚ö° Key Features

### OTP System:
- 6-digit numeric OTPs
- 5-minute expiration timer
- Visual countdown timer
- Resend functionality
- Email verification status tracking

### User Experience:
- Real-time field validation
- Password strength indicators
- Clear error/success messages
- Smooth step transitions
- Loading states and feedback

## üöÄ Testing Notes

**For Development Testing:**
- OTPs are logged to console for development purposes
- Remove console.log statements in production
- The system uses in-memory storage for OTPs (consider Redis for production)

**Sample Test Flow:**
1. Register with a real email address you can access
2. Check both email and console for OTP
3. Test wrong OTP, expired OTP, and correct OTP scenarios
4. Test forgot password with existing user credentials

## üîß Production Considerations

1. **Email Service**: Configure with a production email service (SendGrid, AWS SES, etc.)
2. **OTP Storage**: Move from in-memory to Redis or database
3. **Rate Limiting**: Add proper rate limiting for OTP requests
4. **Logging**: Remove development console.log statements
5. **Security**: Add CSRF protection and input sanitization
6. **Database**: Ensure user data structure matches your database schema

## üìû Support

The implementation is complete and ready to use. Make sure to:
1. Configure your email service credentials
2. Test with real email addresses
3. Customize the email templates as needed
4. Update any styling to match your brand colors

All files are properly integrated with your existing system and follow the same patterns and conventions used in your codebase.
